          <p>He was a man too busy to flush toilets. More than most people Jane had known, he was oblivious to the issuance from his body that might offend. He didnâ€™t believe in deodorant and often professed that with a proper diet and the peppermint castile soap, you would neither perspire nor smell.</p>

      <p>Many books have been written about Steve Jobs.</p>
      <p>"Becoming Steve Jobs" by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli is the most insightful from a business point of view. But the book that best captures who he was as a person is "A Regular Guy", written by his sister Mona Simpson.</p>
      <p>Despite being a novel, it portrays Steve's personality and his interactions with the people around him more objectively than the accounts published since his death. In some passages she writes admiringly of her brother, and in others she is more critical. Mona is a gifted writer with keen psychological insight and her profile of Steve comes across as both nuanced and balanced.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the memoirs written by his daughter Lisa, and his ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, focus on his negative traits and tend to highlight the more undesirable aspects of his personality. I suspect this is because Lisa and Chrisann both felt Steve owed them something he never made good on (whether rightly or wrongly), whereas Mona never needed or wanted anything from him.</p>
