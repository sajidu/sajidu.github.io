        <p>Rebirth is an autobiographical novel by Kamal Ravikant based on his experience walking the Camino de Santiago in northern Spain.</p>
        <p>His journey begins on the banks of the river Ganges in India and ends at the Catedral de Santiago de Compostela.</p>
        <p>Along the way, he meets a whole host of fascinating characters, from a buddhist monk in Dharamsala at the foothills of the Himalayas, to a French sailor afraid of the sea. Each one on their own personal journey, navigating their way through life. Their paths converge on the ancient pilgrimage route of the Camino de Santiago and the result is a tale of remarkable fecundity.</p>
        <p>For me, the jewel at the heart of this beautifully written book is the touching love story between Kat and Julian. A love which is at once beguiling and deeply natural. And a story which is both unexpected and deeply authentic, free of the usual romantic tropes or cliches.</p>
        <p>As I read the book, I quite often found myself pausing from time to time, thinking about what I had just read and drawing parallels to similar situations in my own life.</p>
        <p>All in all, a profoundly spiritual read, which stays with you long after you put the book down.</p>
